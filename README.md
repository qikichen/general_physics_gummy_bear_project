# general_physics_gummy_bear_project
General Physics Project:
    
    Use an iterative method to find a suitable number of gummy bears at which
    a person will survive a fall from a given height
    
    Assumptions made:
        Air resistance = 0 [INITIALLY]
        During impact, no air will replace the dent created by the fall
        Assume a cylindrical container in which the gummy bears are filled
        Gummy bears are fully molten, no air in between the gummy bears
        Person falling is cuboid
