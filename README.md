# general_physics_gummy_bear_project
General Physics Project:
    
    Use an iterative method to find a suitable number of gummy bears at which
    a person will survive a fall from a given height
    
    Assumptions made:
        Air resistance = 0 [INITIALLY]
        During impact, no air will replace the dent created by the fall
        Assume a cylindrical container in which the gummy bears are filled
        Gummy bears are fully molten, no air in between the gummy bears
        Person falling is cuboid

The general physics project is a 25% contribution towards to coursework of the General Physics module. The general physics project requires students to think about a general physics problem and make a poster about it and present it to peers. The project chosen was motivated by the use of dynamics, ordinary differential equations as well as simple harmonic motions.

Intro (envelope calculation):
As an initial calculation gummy bears were modelled as a jelly mixture spring with no trapped air. We can assume that all incident kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy from falling is converted into elastic potential energy in the ‘spring’. The deformation could be calculated as a function of elastic modulus, incident velocity and height. Using simple kinematics, () Finally, we set a post-contact acceleration as the force required in bone breakage (20,000N), which outputs a corresponding deformation and a fall height of 7.1m. This value does not consider air resistance or the pressure on the person upon contact. 


Please be advised that the numbers calculated will NOT ACTUALLY save you from injuries. The number calculated is the threshold of femur breakage and will most certainly not save your femurs.
